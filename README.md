## JusticeBot : A Virtual Legal Assistant
The JusticeBot is an innovative Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based chatbot designed to revolutionize legal information access on Justice Department. Leveraging advanced language models and cutting-edge AI technologies, the JusticeBot facilitates immediate, accurate, and user-friendly guidance across various legal and judicial services. It streamlines complex procedures by providing detailed explanations and step-by-step instructions, ensuring users can efficiently navigate their legal needs.

## About
JusticeBot, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based chatbot, is designed to enhance user experience by offering instant access to various eCourt services, including case searches, hearing schedules, court orders, and payment processes for fines. It further simplifies access to citizen services by delivering clear and concise guidance on legal aid, petition filing, and traffic violation settlements. Additionally, the chatbot promotes transparency in the judicial system by facilitating the live streaming of court cases, while ensuring 24/7 availability of crucial legal information.
Utilizing ChromaDB for efficient data management and data retrieval and AWS infrastructure for scalable and cost-effective deployment, the JusticeBot is built for cost-efficiency and future expansion, with capabilities for Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and potential multilingual support. Despite challenges such as local LLM limitations and the complexity of processing large legal documents, the JusticeBot promises significant social, economic, and environmental benefits by promoting legal awareness, reducing operational costs, and minimizing paper usage, the JusticeBot empowers users, fostering confidence and equitable access to justice.
